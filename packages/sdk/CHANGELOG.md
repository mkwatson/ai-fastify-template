## SDK Versioning Strategy

This SDK follows semantic versioning:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

### Automatic Versioning

The SDK version is automatically managed through:

1. **API Changes**: When the OpenAPI specification changes, the SDK is regenerated
2. **Breaking Changes**: Major version bumps for incompatible API changes
3. **New Features**: Minor version bumps for new endpoints or functionality
4. **Bug Fixes**: Patch version bumps for fixes and improvements

### Release Process

1. **API Development**: Changes made to the Fastify API
2. **OpenAPI Generation**: Specification updated automatically
3. **SDK Generation**: Fern regenerates the TypeScript SDK
4. **Version Calculation**: Semantic version determined from API changes
5. **Publication**: SDK published to NPM registry
6. **Changelog Update**: This file updated with release notes

### Compatibility Matrix

| SDK Version | API Version | Node.js Version | TypeScript Version |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x       | 1.x.x       | ≥18.0.0         | ≥4.9.0             |

### Migration Guides

When breaking changes occur, migration guides will be provided in this changelog to help users upgrade their implementations.
