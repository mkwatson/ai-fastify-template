Think deeply about what makes an exceptional code review—one that elevates both the code and the developer. Consider technical excellence, business impact, maintainability, and team growth.

Now think harder about the specific context of the open PR: What are the risks? What opportunities for improvement exist? What would a senior architect notice that others might miss?

Provide that level of thoughtful, constructive review—adapting your focus based on what you're
examining while maintaining our quality standards.
