Think deeply about what makes an exceptional implementation that passes strict code review on the first attempt—one that demonstrates true software craftsmanship within our established architecture and quality standards.

Now think harder about the specific ticket context: business value, technical complexity, user impact, and integration points. What would a senior architect prioritize? What could go wrong?

Move the selected ticket to 'In Progress' and implement it completely—from fresh branch to ready-for-review PR—while embodying those exceptional standards. Adapt your approach based on the ticket's nature, but maintain our quality guardrails throughout.

Use Linear MCP tools, our quality pipeline commands, and Git workflows as needed. Don't move to 'Done'—that's handled post-review.
