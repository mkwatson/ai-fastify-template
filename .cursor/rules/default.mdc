# AI Fastify Template - Coding Guidelines

Please follow the comprehensive project coding standards outlined in @AGENTS.md

## Key Points

- **Single Source of Truth**: All shared guidelines are maintained in AGENTS.md
- **Quality Pipeline**: Use `pnpm ai:quick`, `pnpm ai:check`, and `pnpm ai:compliance`
- **TypeScript Strict**: No `any` types, explicit return types required
- **Zod Validation**: All inputs must be validated with Zod schemas
- **Fastify Patterns**: Use proper error handling and plugin architecture
- **Testing Required**: Unit and integration tests for all new code

## Project Management

- Use Linear MCP tools for issue tracking and updates
- Use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations (PRs, issues)
- Reference Linear issues in commits and PRs
- Follow conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`

## Cursor-Specific Notes

**Things shared across all AI coding agents are in AGENTS.md.**

Cursor-specific rules can be added here if needed in the future. For now, all guidelines are centralized in AGENTS.md to maintain consistency across OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor IDE.
