# Reports Directory

This directory contains generated build artifacts and quality reports. These files are **not tracked in git** to prevent repository bloat and merge conflicts.

## Report Types

### Mutation Testing (`reports/mutation/`)
- **Generated by**: `pnpm test:mutation` (Stryker)
- **Purpose**: Validates test quality through code mutation analysis
- **Threshold**: 90% mutation score required
- **Output**: `mutation.html` - Interactive HTML report

### Code Coverage (`reports/coverage/`)
- **Generated by**: `pnpm test:coverage` (Vitest + c8)
- **Purpose**: Line/branch coverage analysis
- **Threshold**: 80% coverage required
- **Output**: HTML and LCOV formats

### Performance Benchmarks (`reports/performance/`)
- **Generated by**: Performance testing suite (future)
- **Purpose**: Performance regression detection
- **Output**: JSON and HTML reports

## Usage

```bash
# Generate mutation testing report
pnpm test:mutation
open reports/mutation/mutation.html

# Generate coverage report
pnpm test:coverage
open reports/coverage/index.html

# Full quality validation (includes all reports)
pnpm ai:compliance
```

## CI/CD Integration

In CI/CD pipelines, these reports are:
1. **Generated** in the build environment
2. **Uploaded** as build artifacts
3. **Analyzed** for quality gate enforcement
4. **Stored** in artifact repositories (not git)

## Quality Metadata

For tracking quality trends without storing large reports, see the planned quality metadata system that will track mutation scores, coverage percentages, and trends in lightweight JSON format.
